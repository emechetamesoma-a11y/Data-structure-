🧮 Checkpoint Project – Array & Dot Product Algorithms
👩‍💻 Overview

This project contains two algorithm problems implemented using arrays and nested loops, as required for the checkpoint evaluation.
Each problem demonstrates problem-solving, clarity of code, and use of functions/procedures with parameter passing. 

🧩 Problem 1 – Sum of Distinct Elements from Two Sets
📝 Description

Given two sets of elements, the goal is to find the sum of all distinct elements that appear in either of the sets. 

📝 Description

You are required to:

Write a procedure named dot_product to calculate the dot (scalar) product of two vectors v1 and v2.

Write an algorithm to determine if n pairs of vectors are orthogonal.

Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product = 0.

Modify the algorithm if a function is used instead of a procedure.

💡 Concepts Used

Arrays to represent vectors.

Nested loops to iterate over elements.

Parameter passing (vectors passed to the function/procedure).
